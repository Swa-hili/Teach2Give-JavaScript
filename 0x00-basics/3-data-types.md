# Data Types

JavaScript has the following basic data types which are also the primitive data types in JavaScript:

- String

- Number

- Boolean

- Null

- Undefined

 - Bigint

- Symbol

__String__

Refers to a sequence of characters enclosed within single quotes ('), double quotes (") or backticks.
```
let firstName = "john";
let lastName = "doe";
let username = `john_doe`;
```

__Number__

JavaScript has only one type for numbers: it can store both integers and decimals.
```
let age = 25; // Integer
let price = 99.99; // Decimal
let notANumber = NaN; // Not a Number (invalid math operation)
```

__Boolean__

Booleans represent true or false values, often used for decision-making.

Boolean can either be true or false.
```
let isMale = true;
let isFemale = false;
```


__Undefined__

Refers to a variable that has been declared but not initialized. 

```
let country;

console.log(country); // Output: undefined
```

__Null__

null is an intentional absence of a value. Unlike undefined, which means "not assigned," null means "empty on purpose."

```
let car = null; // No car yet
```

__BigInt__

Used for numbers beyond JavaScriptâ€™s Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER (9,007,199,254,740,991).

```
let bigNumber = 123456789012345678901234567890n; // "n" at the end makes it a BigInt
console.log(bigNumber);
```


## Checking the type of a variable using the typeof operator

You can check the type of a variable using the typeof operator in JavaScript.
```

let bigNumber = 123456789012345678901234567890n;
console.log(typeof bigNumber); // bigint
// OR
console.log(typeof bigNumber); // bigint

const age = 25;
const fullName = "John Doe";

console.log(typeof age); // number
console.log(typeof fullName); // string
```
